# Shortest Distance to a Character
Given a string `str` and a character `char`, return an array of integers representing the shortest distance from the character `char` in the string.

### Example 1:
```
Input: str = "loveleetcode", char = 'e'
Output: [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0]
```

Note:
* `str` length is between `[1, 10000]`.
* `char` is a single character, and guaranteed to be in `str`.
All letters in `str` and `char` are lowercase.
