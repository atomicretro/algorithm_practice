# Sort By Parity
Given an array `arr` of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all the even elements of `arr`, followed by all the odd elements of `arr`. Do not modify the original array.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

### Example:
```
Input: [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1] OR [4,2,3,1] OR [2,4,1,3] OR [4,2,1,3]
```
